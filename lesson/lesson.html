    <h3>The data required for $\C$ to be a category</h3>
    <p>
      To be a category, $\C$ has to possess a bunch of <i>objects</i>. Those
      objects can be anything and we assume that they form a collection called
      $\ob \C$.

      Usually, $\ob \C$ is an homogeneous collection of things, concepts, ideas,
      constructions... For instance, $\ob \C$ could be the collection of all
      human being, one object of $\C$ per human being. $\ob \C$ could also be
      the natural numbers, one object of $\C$ per natural number. But the truth
      is, we don't really need to know, the only thing to remember is that we
      have this collection. What it represents is none of our business.

      Objects are lonely, hence category connects them. For any two objects,
      let's call them $X, Y \in \ob \C$, we have a new collection of things. We
      call it $\C(X, Y)$. This collection represents the links (also called
      arrows or morphisms) from $X$ to $Y$. Beware, $\C(X, Y)$ is not the same
      thing as $\C(Y, X)$, arrows are directed! To denote an arrow $f \in \C(X,
      Y)$, we often write $f : X \to Y$. It represents a way to link $X$ to $Y$,
      and there could be a lot of ways to link $X$ to $Y$, the collection $\C(X,
      Y)$ can have a lot of entities.

      For every object $X \in \ob \C$, there is a special arrow from $X$ to $X$,
      called the identity. We write $\id_X : X \to X$.

      One piece of data is missing in order to form a category. We need a way to
      merge arrows together. </p>
      <p>  Suppose we have three objects $X, Y, Z \in \ob C$
      and two arrows $f \in \C(X, Y)$ and $g : \C(Y, Z)$.</p>
      <p> The composition of $f$
      and $g$ is the data of an arrow in $\C(X, Z)$ and is written $g\circ f$.
    </p>
      <br />
      <i
        >Select $f$, then $g$ and click on the composition button (top right) to see the
        compisite arrow.</i

    <h3>The laws this data must follow for $\C$ to be a category</h3>
    <p>
      The first law concerns the identity, it tells us that for any arrow $f : X
      \to Y$, then $f \circ \id_X = f$ and $\id_Y \circ f = f$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second law is associativity, thanks to it, we can
      <i>not care</i> when we follow a path in a diagram. Indeed, look at the
      three arrows below. There are two ways of composing them, one gives
      $h\circ (g\circ f)$ and the other $(h\circ g) \circ f$. A priori, these
      arrows need not to be equal, and associativity states they indeed are. $$
      h\circ (g\circ f) = (h\circ g) \circ f$$ This allows us to simply write
      $h\circ g \circ f$. Convenient, we can follow a path in a diagram without
      worrying about the parenthesis.

      Now that we know what a category is, it is time to start doing interesting
      construction with it. Inside the category $\C$, we can construct
      particular objects that come with <i>superpower</i>. In general, when we
      have two object $X, Y$ of the category, we don't know a priori what are
      the morphisms between them. There could be none, there could be a lot,
      they could have interesting properties, or not. We don't know. We say that
      an object $X$ has a <i>superpower</i>, (really called a
      <i>universal property</i>) if we have interesting things to say about the
      arrows from (or to) $X$. The most basic example is the notion of initial
      object. An object $I \in \C$ is initial if, for any other object $Y$ of
      the category, there exists one and only one arrow from $I$ to $Y$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dually, an object $T$ is terminal if there exactly one arrow from any
      object $Y$ to $T$.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >We instanciated a terminal and an initial object on the screen.
        Instantiate other objects and draw some arrows using their
        superpower.</i

    <p>
      Let's move on to another interesting construction, the product. When we
      have two objects $A, B \in \ob \C$, we can form their product. It is the
      data of a new object, that we call $A\times B$, and two arrows, the
      projections. The first one is $p : A\times B \to A$ and the second is $q :
      A\times B \to B$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interesting thing with the product is its superpower, it can
      instantiate arrow from nothingness! Suppose we have another object $X \in
      \ob C$ and two maps $f : X \to A$, and $g : X \to B$. Then the superpower
      of the product creates a (unique, but let's not bother too much with that)
      new arrow $\langle f, g\rangle : X \to A \times B$. This new arrow is such
      that $$ p \circ \langle f; g\rangle = f$$ and $$ q \circ \langle f;
      g\rangle = g$$ To understand the product, click on $X$, $A\times B$, then
      on the question mark to see the magical arrow appear. The equations above
      means that the two triangles inside the big one are commutative. To go
      from $X$ to $A$, it is the same thing to follow $f$, or to follow $\langle
      f; g\rangle$ and then $p$.

      So what is this weird construction for? Well you know it, it is the
      greatest common divisor! Indeed, say our category $\C$ has for objects the
      natural numbers $0, 1, 2, \dots$. Between any two natural number $n$ and
      $m$, put one, and only one, arrow $n \to m$ if $n$ divides $m$. For
      instance there is an arrow from $2$ to $4$ but none from $9$ to $3$. (what
      are the initial and terminal object here?). In this category, let's
      compute the product of any two numbers $a$ and $b$. It is an object, let's
      call it $a \land b$. It has two projections $p : a\land b \to a$ and $q :
      a\land b \to b$. By definition of the arrows, it means this object divides
      both $a$ and $b$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we unfold the definition of its superpower. For any other number $x$,
      if we have an arrow $f : x \to a$, that is if $x \mid a$, and another
      arrow $g : x \to b$, that is $x \mid b$, then we have an arrow $\langle f;
      g\rangle : x \to a \land b$, that is $x \mid a \land b$. Let's rewrite all
      of that in mathematical terms. We have $$ \forall x \in \mathbb{N},
      \;\;\text{ if } \;\; x \mid a \;\; \text{ and } \;\; x \mid b \;\; \text{
      then } \;\; x \mid a \land b $$ This is the definition of the greatest
      common divisor!
    </p>
    <p>
      So why is it called <i>product</i> then? Oh, because this is also the
      cartesian product of sets. Take $\C$ to be the category of all sets and
      the arrows between any two objects $X, Y$ are the usual functions between
      sets. For two object (so two sets here) $A$ and $B$, we define $$ A \times
      B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A, \; b \in B \} $$ to be the cartesian product.
      We have to natural maps $p : A \times B \to A$ and $q : A\times B \to B$
      defined by $$ p((a, b)) = a $$ and $$ q((a, b)) = b $$ Then having two
      functions $f : X \to A$ and $g : X \to B$ creates a new function $\langle
      f, g \rangle : X \to A\times B$ such that for all $x \in X$ $$ \langle f,
      g \rangle(x) = (f(x), g(x)) $$ and indeed $p \circ \langle f, g \rangle(x)
      = f(x)$ and $$q \circ \langle f, g \rangle(x) = g(x)$$

      Now it's you to play. Back to our general category $\C$. Here's an object
      $A$, and the product to itself $A\times A$. Your goal is to create an
      arrow from the top $A$ to $A\times A$. Recall that in a category, the
      arrow cannot be instiated from nowhere. Good luck.
