            <h3>The data required for $\C$ to be a category</h3>
            <p>
              To be a category, $\C$ has to possess a bunch of <i>objects</i>.
              Those objects can be anything and we assume that they form a
              collection called $\ob \C$.
              <br />
              <i
                >Double click anywhere on the screen to create a new object of
                the category $\C$.</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, $\ob \C$ is an homogeneous collection of things,
              concepts, ideas, constructions... For instance, $\ob \C$ could be
              the collection of all human being, one object of $\C$ per human
              being. $\ob \C$ could also be the natural numbers, one object of
              $\C$ per natural number. But the truth is, we don't really need to
              know, the only thing to remember is that we have this collection.
              What it represents is none of our business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Objects are lonely, hence category connects them. For any two
              objects, let's call them $X, Y \in \ob \C$, we have a new
              collection of things. We call it $\C(X, Y)$. This collection
              represents the links (also called arrows or morphisms) from $X$ to
              $Y$. Beware, $\C(X, Y)$ is not the same thing as $\C(Y, X)$,
              arrows are directed! To denote an arrow $f \in \C(X, Y)$, we often
              write $f : X \to Y$. It represents a way to link $X$ to $Y$, and
              there could be a lot of ways to link $X$ to $Y$, the collection
              $\C(X, Y)$ can have a lot of entities.
              <br />
              <i
                >Invoke two objects $X, Y$ of $\C$. Click on $X$, $Y$ and then
                on the connection button to create a morphism from $X$ to $Y$.
                Try to create multiple links between the two, in different
                directions.</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              For every object $X \in \ob \C$, there is a special arrow from $X$
              to $X$, called the identity. We write $\id_X : X \to X$.
              <br />
              <i
                >When you try to draw an arrow between objects with the same
                name, you can can choose the identity button.</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              One piece of data is missing in order to form a category. We need
              a way to merge arrows together. Suppose we have three objects $X,
              Y, Z \in \ob C$ and two arrows $f \in \C(X, Y)$ and $g : \C(Y,
              Z)$. The composition of $f$ and $g$ is the data of an arrow in
              $\C(X, Z)$ and is written $g\circ f$.
              <br />
              <i
                >Select $f$, then $g$ and click on the composition button to see
                the compisite arrow.</i
              >
            </p>

        </div>

          <div style="display: grid; width: 50em; text-align: justify">
            <h3>The laws this data must follow for $\C$ to be a category</h3>
            <p>
              The first law concerns the identity, it tells us that for any
              arrow $f : X \to Y$, then $f \circ \id_X = f$ and $\id_Y \circ f =
              f$.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second law is associativity, thanks to it, we can
              <i>not care</i> when we follow a path in a diagram. Indeed, look
              at the three arrows below. There are two ways of composing them,
              one gives $h\circ (g\circ f)$ and the other $(h\circ g) \circ f$.
              A priori, these arrows need not to be equal, and associativity
              states they indeed are. $$ h\circ (g\circ f) = (h\circ g) \circ
              f$$ This allows us to simply write $h\circ g \circ f$. Convenient,
              we can follow a path in a diagram without worrying about the
              parenthesis.

              Now that we know what a category is, it is time to start doing
              interesting construction with it. Inside the category $\C$, we can
              construct particular objects that come with <i>superpower</i>. In
              general, when we have two object $X, Y$ of the category, we don't
              know a priori what are the morphisms between them. There could be
              none, there could be a lot, they could have interesting
              properties, or not. We don't know. We say that an object $X$ has a
              <i>superpower</i>, (really called a <i>universal property</i>) if
              we have interesting things to say about the arrows from (or to)
              $X$. The most basic example is the notion of initial object. An
              object $I \in \C$ is initial if, for any other object $Y$ of the
              category, there exists one and only one arrow from $I$ to $Y$.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dually, an object $T$ is terminal if there exactly one arrow from
              any object $Y$ to $T$.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i
                >We instanciated a terminal and an initial object on the screen.
                Instantiate other objects and draw some arrows using their
                superpower.</i

            <p>
              Let's move on to another interesting construction, the product.
              When we have two objects $A, B \in \ob \C$, we can form their
              product. It is the data of a new object, that we call $A\times B$,
              and two arrows, the projections. The first one is $p : A\times B
              \to A$ and the second is $q : A\times B \to B$.
            </p>
            <p>
              The interesting thing with the product is its superpower, it can
              instantiate arrow from nothingness! Suppose we have another object
              $X \in \ob C$ and two maps $f : X \to A$, and $g : X \to B$. Then
              the superpower of the product creates a (unique, but let's not
              bother too much with that) new arrow $\langle f, g\rangle : X \to
              A \times B$. This new arrow is such that $$ p \circ \langle f;
              g\rangle = f$$ and $$ q \circ \langle f; g\rangle = g$$ To
              understand the product, click on $X$, $A\times B$, then on the
              question mark to see the magical arrow appear. The equations above
              means that the two triangles inside the big one are commutative.
              To go from $X$ to $A$, it is the same thing to follow $f$, or to
              follow $\langle f; g\rangle$ and then $p$.

            <p>
              So what is this weird construction for? Well you know it, it is
              the greatest common divisor! Indeed, say our category $\C$ has for
              objects the natural numbers $0, 1, 2, \dots$. Between any two
              natural number $n$ and $m$, put one, and only one, arrow $n \to m$
              if $n$ divides $m$. For instance there is an arrow from $2$ to $4$
              but none from $9$ to $3$. (what are the initial and terminal
              object here?). In this category, let's compute the product of any
              two numbers $a$ and $b$. It is an object, let's call it $a \land
              b$. It has two projections $p : a\land b \to a$ and $q : a\land b
              \to b$. By definition of the arrows, it means this object divides
              both $a$ and $b$.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, we unfold the definition of its superpower. For any other
              number $x$, if we have an arrow $f : x \to a$, that is if $x \mid
              a$, and another arrow $g : x \to b$, that is $x \mid b$, then we
              have an arrow $\langle f; g\rangle : x \to a \land b$, that is $x
              \mid a \land b$. Let's rewrite all of that in mathematical terms.
              We have $$ \forall x \in \mathbb{N}, \;\;\text{ if } \;\; x \mid a
              \;\; \text{ and } \;\; x \mid b \;\; \text{ then } \;\; x \mid a
              \land b $$ This is the definition of the greatest common divisor!
            </p>
            <p>
              So why is it called <i>product</i> then? Oh, because this is also
              the cartesian product of sets. Take $\C$ to be the category of all
              sets and the arrows between any two objects $X, Y$ are the usual
              functions between sets. For two object (so two sets here) $A$ and
              $B$, we define $$ A \times B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A, \; b \in B
              \} $$ to be the cartesian product. We have to natural maps $p : A
              \times B \to A$ and $q : A\times B \to B$ defined by $$ p((a, b))
              = a $$ and $$ q((a, b)) = b $$ Then having two functions $f : X
              \to A$ and $g : X \to B$ creates a new function $\langle f, g
              \rangle : X \to A\times B$ such that for all $x \in X$ $$ \langle
              f, g \rangle(x) = (f(x), g(x)) $$ and indeed $p \circ \langle f, g
              \rangle(x) = f(x)$ and $$q \circ \langle f, g \rangle(x) = g(x)$$

              Now it's you to play. Back to our general category $\C$. Here's an
              object $A$, and the product to itself $A\times A$. Your goal is to
              create an arrow from the top $A$ to $A\times A$. Recall that in a
              category, the arrow cannot be instiated from nowhere. Good luck.
